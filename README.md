# Memes Against Friends

Memes Against Friends is a party game you play in iMessage where you compete with friends to create the greatest memes.

The game is played by rounds with one player (the judge) choosing a photo to meme and everyone else submitting their wittiest captions for the photo. The judge then picks the winner and the next round starts with a new judge. Check out the landing page for more information and don't forget to upvote it on Product Hunt if you like it. Have fun!
